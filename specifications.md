## The OpenMP Specification

The SOLLVE subproject actively contributes to advancing the OpenMP standard with multiple of the participating organizations also being member of the [OpenMP Architecture Review Board](https://www.openmp.org/about/members/). We participate in regular meetings, mailing-list discussions, writing drafts for the next version and voting for changes of the document.

Some of additions in OpenMP 5.1 have been spearheaded by SOLLVE members, such as the assume(s) directives and loop transformations. SOLLVE ensures OpenMP will be ready for the upcoming generation of supercomputers of the Exascale Computing Project. This includes an emphasis on target offloading production-ready compiler support.

The latest version of of the OpenMP specification is available for download on the [OpenMP document website](https://www.openmp.org/specifications/).
